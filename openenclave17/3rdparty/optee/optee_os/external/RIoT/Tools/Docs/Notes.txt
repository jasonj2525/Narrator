If you run RIoT and RIoTDemo together, you get the update demo.

In the version in the repo, the devices look at twin.targetProperties and updae and
self-report.

The version being worked here introduces a new deevice/twin called ControlDevice with a property VersionUmber
that is uddated by the GUI app, and can be queried by the devices AND by the attestaion server to 
have an authoritative check that the attestation data is good.

This is just started on friday.
